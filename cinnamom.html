            </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Yeast</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
                <li>Cut-in the shortening.</li>
                <li>Add the milk, stirring with a knife until the dough is soft and slightly sticky.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough until it "springs back" when you push your hand into it.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough into a 9" by 13" (23cm by 30cm) rectangle. Use a 9" by 13" (23cm by 30cm) baking pan as a mould for the size.</li>
                <li>Brush butter over the dough, leaving about ¼" (0.75cm) around the edges clear.</li>
                <li>Combine brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon and salt. Sprinkle on buttered dough, leaving about ¼" around the edges clear.</li>
                <li>Press the sugar mixture down. Roll the dough up lengthwise into a log, as tight as you can.</li>
                <li>Trim the edges, cut into eight pieces.</li>
                <li>Arrange the buns in a small pan, so that all the buns are touching.</li>
                <li>Bake at 425°F (210˚C) for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
